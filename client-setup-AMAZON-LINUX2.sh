#FOR NGINX INSTALLATION ON AMAZON LINUX 2, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THE NGINX WEBSITE BELOW
#https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/#installing-prebuilt-amazon-linux-2-packages

#--------IMPORTANT NOTES ON NGINX--------------
#REPLACING THE SITES AVAILABLE/ENABLED FOLDERS AND
#CREATING SYMLINKS IS EASIER WITH DEBIAN/UBUNTU 
#BECAUSE THE 'sites-enabled/available' FOLDERS EXIST
#IN THOSE DISTRIBUTIONS BUT NOT IN CENTOS/AMAZON LINUX.
#THE REASON IS THAT INSIDE THE DEFUALT NGINX CONF FILE
#(WHICH ON BOTH DISTRIBUTIONS IS LOCATED IN '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf')
#I RECOMMEND YOU DON'T DELETE THE DEFAULT CONF SINCE IT CONTAINS 
#IMPORTANT STUFF THE 'http' AND 'events' DIRECTIVES.
#INSIDE THE DEFAULT CONF, THERE IS A LINE THAT SAYS '
#include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;' FOR BOTH DISTRIBUTIONS BUT 
#THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL LINE IN UBUNTU THAT SAYS
#'include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;' SO THIS IS WHY THE 
#'/etc/nginx/sites-enabled and sites-enabled/' DON'T
#EXIST ON AMAZON LINUX 2 DISTRIBUTION.


#----------IMPORTANT NOTE ON FRONT-END AXIOS ROUTES--------
#MAKE SURE THEY DON'T START WITH 'localhost'. 



#ASSUMING YOU HAVE ALREADY BUILT THE CLIENT PACKAGES, MOVE
#THE BUILD FOLDER TO THE RIGHT DIRECTORY

rm -rf /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf
